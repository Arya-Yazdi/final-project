#### Description:
Queue is a website designed to allow our fellow CS50 students to post what is on their mind as they go through the weekly lectures, labs and problem sets. Just like most web apps, you do need to log in or register in order to use the service therefore if you are new to the website you are greeted with a login page and prompted to log in or register if you do not have an account yet. After signing in, you will see the homepage of the website, where at the top you are able to make a post, and below that you can see all the posts made by other students.

Moving on to the settings page, this is where you can view your account info, such as your username, number of posts you have made and the date and time at which you have made your account. Below that you can find an option to change your password, and below that an option to delete your account. Coding an option for deleting an account was quite interesting as first you have to ensure you delete all the posts the user made from the database and only then you can delete the user from the database.

Lastly we have the “My posts” page where the user can not only view all of the posts they have made, but also delete their posts by providing the title of their post. Their post is then deleted from the database and removed from the homepage.

Overall, this project enhanced my ability to code using HTML, CSS and Flask/Python and pushed me to add features to the page which pushed me out of my comfort zone even further. Although I am satisfied with the outcome of my project, there is still some room for improvement such as adding more features, handling corner cases better and using more abstractions.
